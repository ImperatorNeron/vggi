# Quick Review

## Task Overview
In this update, I have successfully completed a task related to rendering the Surface of Revolution “Wellenkugel” using WebGL. The main goals were to manage vertex buffers for U and V coordinates and ensure smooth rendering of the surface.

## Key Changes:
1. **Model Renderer Improvements**:
   - Implemented two main functions: `BufferDataHelper` and `DrawHelper`.
   - **`BufferDataHelper`**: This function processes vertex lists for U and V coordinates, creates WebGL buffers, and stores vertex data.
   - **`DrawHelper`**: Manages the rendering of each line by setting up vertex attributes and drawing the lines.

2. **Surface Data Generation**:
   - Added `CreateSurfaceData(uData, vData, scale)` function that generates vertex lists for the U and V directions using parametric equations for the Wellenkugel surface.
   - **`getVertex`**: Calculates 3D points based on the provided U and V values and scales the result.

3. **Interface Updates**:
   - Adjusted the interface for more flexible handling of shape.

## Next Steps:
- Complete the second practical assignment.
